#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. 
Software engineering is solving real-world problems through technology.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Overview of the Evolution of Software Engineering: The history of software engineering traces back to the 1940s and 1950s with the emergence of the first digital computers. Over the decades, software engineering evolved in response to the growing complexity of software systems and the need for structured development methodologies.
2. Key Milestones and Innovations: Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
3. Influential Figures in Software Engineering History: Influential figures include pioneers such as Alan Turing, Grace Hopper, Fred Brooks, and others who made significant contributions to the field through their research, inventions, and writings.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5.  Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers.
6.  Maintenance  Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the way of talking to AI. If you want AI to do exactly what you need, you must know how to talk to it. The better your prompt, the better the AIâ€™s response!.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt tell me about climate change

Improved prompt is a clear, specific and detailed request that helps AI models generates relevant and accurate responses.
