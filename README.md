Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, building, testing and maintaining software. 
Software engineering is important in the technology industry because it supporting business growth by enables the creation of high quility software solutions tha power businesses, industries and daily life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The term "software engineering" was coined at a NATO conference, highlighting the need for structured software development methodologies.
2. Agile Development (2001) – The Agile Manifesto revolutionized software development by promoting iterative, flexible, and customer-centric approaches over rigid traditional methods.
3. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The term "software engineering" was coined at a NATO conference, highlighting the need for structured software development methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Analysis understanding user needs and defining software specifications
2. Planning writting down project scope, timeline and cost
3. Design creating system architecture and interface designs
4. Implementation writing and compiling the source code
5. Testing identifying and fixing bugs before deployment
6. Deployment release the software to end user
7. Maintenance updating and improving software over time

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is where each each phase must be completed before the next begins and it may take a long time to complete. This defined projects with stable requirements such as government or regulatory software.

Agile methodologies is where testing is done throughout the project, development occurs in sprints. This suited for project with envolving requirements, allowing for continuous improvement and faster delivery eg web applications

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer design, code, test, maintains codes, implements software features and trobleshoots issues.

Quality Assurance designs and executes test plans to ensure software reliability and performance.

Project Manager oversees project timelines, coordinates team efforts and ensure alignment with business goal. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environment(IDEs) is the tool that provide code editing, debugging and automation features eg Visual studio, EntelliJ IDEA

Version Control System (VCS) is the system that track code changes and enable collaboration eg Git, SVN

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software bugs implement robust testing frameworks and continuous integration

Changing software requirement use agile methodologies and iterative development

Software testing conflicts open communication, collaborative planning and clear role definitions 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit is the process of testing the smallest parts of your code like individual functions or methods to make sure they work correctly.

Integration different units or components of software applications are tested as a combined entity

System evaluates the entire software system to ensure it meets user needs and requirements

Acceptance evaluates software to ensure it meets user needs and business requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of structuring or crafting an instruction in order to produce optimal outputs for AI tool.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt tell me about climate change

Improved prompt is a clear, specific and detailed request that helps AI models generates relevant and accurate responses.
